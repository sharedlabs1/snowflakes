== Objective
In this lab, you will manually load data into Snowflake and automate data loading using the COPY command.

== Prerequisites
- Access to a Snowflake account.
- Sample CSV file (e.g., `employees.csv`).

== Steps
1. **Manual Data Load Using the Web Interface**
   . Create a new table in the **Worksheet**:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE employees (id INT, name STRING, age INT, department STRING);
----

. Use the **Data Load Wizard** in the **Databases** tab to manually upload the `employees.csv` file to the **employees** table.

2. **Verifying Data Load**
. Run the following query to verify the data:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM employees;
----


3. **Automated Data Load Using COPY Command**
. Stage the CSV file using an internal Snowflake stage:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_stage; PUT file://employees.csv @my_stage;
----


. Use the COPY INTO command to load the data into the table:

[source,sql]
----
COPY INTO employees FROM @my_stage FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV');
----


4. **Verify Automated Load**
. Check the data in the **employees** table:

[source,sql]
----

SELECT * FROM employees;

----


== Conclusion

- You have successfully loaded data into Snowflake using both manual and automated methods, including the COPY command.
