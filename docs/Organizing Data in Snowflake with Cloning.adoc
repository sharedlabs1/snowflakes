== Objective
In this lab, you will organize your Snowflake data using cloning features to create quick, efficient copies of databases, schemas, and tables.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.

== Steps
1. **Cloning a Table**
   . Clone the **employees** table into a new table:
[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE employees_clone CLONE employees;
----


2. **Verifying the Clone**
. Query both the original and cloned table to verify:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM employees; SELECT * FROM employees_clone;
----


3. **Cloning a Schema**
. Clone the entire schema containing the **employees** table:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE SCHEMA demo_schema_clone CLONE demo_schema;
----


4. **Understanding Zero-Copy Cloning**
. Explore Snowflakeâ€™s zero-copy cloning feature and observe how cloning does not duplicate the underlying storage, making it efficient.

== Conclusion
- You have used cloning to quickly create copies of tables and schemas in Snowflake without duplicating the underlying data.
