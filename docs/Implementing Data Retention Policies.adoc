== Objective
In this lab, you will configure data retention policies in Snowflake to manage how long data is retained before it is purged from the system.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.

== Steps
1. **Creating a Table with Retention Policies**
   . Create a table to store sales data and configure a retention policy for it:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE sales_with_retention (id INT, amount DECIMAL(10, 2), sale_date DATE) DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 7;
----


2. **Inserting Data**
. Insert some sample data into the table:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO sales_with_retention VALUES (1, 100, '2023-01-01');
----


3. **Verifying Data Retention Settings**
. Query the retention settings for the table:

[source,sql]
----
SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS' IN TABLE sales_with_retention;
----


4. **Purging Expired Data**
. After the retention period has passed, verify that the expired data is purged automatically:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM sales_with_retention WHERE sale_date < CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL '7 DAYS';
----


5. **Customizing Retention Policies**
. Adjust the retention time by modifying the table's retention policy:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE sales_with_retention SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 14;
----


6. **Manually Purging Data**
. If necessary, manually purge specific data from the table:

[source,sql]
----
DELETE FROM sales_with_retention WHERE sale_date < CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL '14 DAYS';
----


7. **Monitoring Retention and Purging Activity**
. Use the **ACCOUNT_USAGE** views to monitor retention and purging activities, including when data is scheduled for deletion.

== Conclusion
- You have successfully configured and managed data retention policies in Snowflake, ensuring data is automatically purged after a set retention period or manually deleted when necessary.
