== Objective
In this lab, you will create and manage materialized views in Snowflake to optimize query performance on frequently accessed data.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.

== Steps
1. **Creating a Materialized View**
   . Create a table and insert data:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE sales_data (id INT, amount DECIMAL(10, 2), category STRING); 
INSERT INTO sales_data VALUES (1, 100.50, 'Electronics'), (2, 300.75, 'Furniture');
----


. Create a materialized view on the table:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS SELECT category, SUM(amount) AS total_sales FROM sales_data GROUP BY category;
----


2. **Querying the Materialized View**
. Query the materialized view to observe the aggregated results:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM sales_summary;
----


3. **Monitoring Materialized View Performance**
. Use the **VIEW_USAGE_HISTORY** view to monitor the performance and freshness of the materialized view:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM VIEW_USAGE_HISTORY WHERE VIEW_NAME = 'sales_summary';
----


4. **Refreshing the Materialized View**
. Manually refresh the materialized view if needed:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary RECLUSTER;
----


== Conclusion
- You have successfully created and managed materialized views in Snowflake to improve query performance.
