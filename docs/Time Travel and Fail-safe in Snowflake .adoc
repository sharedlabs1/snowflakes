== Objective
In this lab, you will use Snowflake's **Time Travel** feature to restore data to a previous state and explore the **Fail-safe** mechanism.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.

== Steps
1. **Creating and Modifying a Table**
   . Create a table and insert some initial data:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE employees_time_travel (id INT, name STRING); INSERT INTO employees_time_travel VALUES (1, 'John Doe');
----


2. **Making Changes to the Table**
. Update the table:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO employees_time_travel VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith'); DELETE FROM employees_time_travel WHERE id = 1;
----


3. **Using Time Travel to Restore Data**
. Use **Time Travel** to query the table as it existed before the delete operation:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM employees_time_travel AT (OFFSET -5 MINUTES);
----


4. **Restoring a Dropped Table**
. Drop the table:

[source,sql]
----
DROP TABLE employees_time_travel;
----

Use Time Travel to **Undrop** the table:

[source,sql]
----
UNDROP TABLE employees_time_travel;
----


5. **Exploring Fail-safe**
. Learn how Snowflake retains deleted objects for 7 days using the Fail-safe mechanism, ensuring the ability to recover critical data.

== Conclusion
- You have successfully used Time Travel to recover data in Snowflake and explored how Fail-safe helps protect deleted objects.
