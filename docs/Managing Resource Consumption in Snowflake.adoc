== Objective
In this lab, you will monitor and manage resource consumption in Snowflake, including virtual warehouse usage and query performance.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.

== Steps
1. **Monitoring Warehouse Usage**
   . Use the **WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY** view to monitor virtual warehouse usage:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY WHERE START_TIME > CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL '1 DAY';
----


2. **Analyzing Query Performance**
. Use the **QUERY_HISTORY** view to monitor query performance:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM QUERY_HISTORY WHERE EXECUTION_STATUS = 'SUCCESS';
----


3. **Suspending and Resuming Warehouses**
. Suspend a running warehouse to reduce resource consumption:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse SUSPEND;
----


. Resume the warehouse when needed:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse RESUME;
----


4. **Setting Auto-Suspend and Auto-Resume**
. Set up auto-suspend and auto-resume for a warehouse:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 300; ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse SET AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;
----


== Conclusion
- You have successfully managed resource consumption in Snowflake by monitoring warehouse usage, analyzing query performance, and optimizing resource allocation.
