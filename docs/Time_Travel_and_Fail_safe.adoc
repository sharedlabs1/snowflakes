= Lab 18: Handling Time-Series Data in Snowflake  


== Objective
In this lab, you will learn how to handle time-series data in Snowflake, including date and time functions, window functions, and analyzing trends over time.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.
- Sample dataset with date fields.

== Steps
1. **Creating a Table with Time-Series Data**
   . Create a table to store sales data over time:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE sales_time_series (sale_date DATE, amount DECIMAL(10,2)); INSERT INTO sales_time_series VALUES ('2023-01-01', 100), ('2023-01-02', 150), ('2023-01-03', 200);
----


2. **Querying Data by Date Range**
. Use the **BETWEEN** operator to filter data by date:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM sales_time_series WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-02';
----


3. **Calculating Running Totals**
. Use a window function to calculate a running total of sales over time:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT sale_date, amount, SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS running_total FROM sales_time_series;
----


4. **Extracting Date Parts**
. Use date functions to extract parts of a date (e.g., year, month, day):

[source,sql]
----
SELECT sale_date, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month FROM sales_time_series;
----


5. **Handling Date and Time Intervals**
. Perform date arithmetic to calculate intervals between dates:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT sale_date, amount, DATEDIFF('day', '2023-01-01', sale_date) AS days_since_start FROM sales_time_series;
----


== Conclusion
- You have successfully handled time-series data in Snowflake, using date functions, window functions, and date arithmetic to analyze trends over time.
