== Objective
In this lab, you will configure database replication and failover to ensure high availability and disaster recovery in Snowflake.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access with multi-region setup.

== Steps
1. **Setting Up Replication**
   . Create a primary database:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE primary_db;
----


. Enable replication for the primary database:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER DATABASE primary_db ENABLE REPLICATION TO REGION 'US-WEST';
----


2. **Creating a Secondary Database**
. Set up a secondary database in a different region:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE secondary_db FROM REPLICATION OF primary_db;
----


3. **Simulating a Failover**
. Simulate a failover scenario by suspending the primary region:

[source,sql]
----

ALTER DATABASE primary_db FAILOVER TO secondary_db;
----


4. **Testing Data Access**
. Access the **secondary_db** and query the replicated data:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM secondary_db.public.some_table;
----


5. **Monitoring Replication**
. Use the **REPLICATION_DATABASES** view to monitor replication:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM REPLICATION_DATABASES;
----


== Conclusion
- You have successfully set up database replication and failover in Snowflake, ensuring high availability and disaster recovery.
