== Objective
In this lab, you will implement row-level security (RLS) in Snowflake using secure views to control access to specific rows of data based on user roles.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access with administrative privileges.

== Steps
1. **Creating the Base Table**
   . Create a base table to store sales data, including a region column for restricting access:
  
[source,sql]
----
   CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sales_data_rls (
     id INT, 
     product STRING, 
     amount DECIMAL(10, 2), 
     region STRING
   );
   INSERT INTO sales_data_rls VALUES 
   (1, 'Laptop', 1000, 'North America'), 
   (2, 'Phone', 500, 'Europe'), 
   (3, 'Tablet', 300, 'Asia');
----

2. **Creating Roles for Regional Access**
   . Create roles to represent regional sales managers:
  
[source,sql]
----
   CREATE ROLE north_america_manager;
   CREATE ROLE europe_manager;
   CREATE ROLE asia_manager;
----

3. **Granting Access to the Base Table**
   . Grant the necessary access to the **sales_data_rls** table:
   
[source,sql]
----
   GRANT SELECT ON sales_data_rls TO ROLE north_america_manager;
   GRANT SELECT ON sales_data_rls TO ROLE europe_manager;
   GRANT SELECT ON sales_data_rls TO ROLE asia_manager;
----

4. **Creating a Secure View for North America**
   . Create a secure view that restricts access to rows where the region is "North America":
   
[source,sql]
----
   CREATE SECURE VIEW north_america_sales_view AS
   SELECT * FROM sales_data_rls WHERE region = 'North America';
   GRANT SELECT ON north_america_sales_view TO ROLE north_america_manager;
----

5. **Creating Secure Views for Other Regions**
   . Create similar secure views for Europe and Asia:
   
[source,sql]
----
   CREATE SECURE VIEW europe_sales_view AS
   SELECT * FROM sales_data_rls WHERE region = 'Europe';
   GRANT SELECT ON europe_sales_view TO ROLE europe_manager;

   CREATE SECURE VIEW asia_sales_view AS
   SELECT * FROM sales_data_rls WHERE region = 'Asia';
   GRANT SELECT ON asia_sales_view TO ROLE asia_manager;
----

6. **Testing the Views with Regional Managers**
   . Log in as the **north_america_manager** and query the secure view:
   
[source,sql]
----
   SELECT * FROM north_america_sales_view;
----
   . Verify that only North American sales data is returned.

7. **Applying Row-Level Security Based on Session Context**
   . Modify the secure view to apply dynamic row-level security based on the session role:
   
[source,sql]
----
   CREATE OR REPLACE SECURE VIEW dynamic_sales_view AS
   SELECT * 
   FROM sales_data_rls
   WHERE region = CASE 
     WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'NORTH_AMERICA_MANAGER' THEN 'North America'
     WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'EUROPE_MANAGER' THEN 'Europe'
     WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'ASIA_MANAGER' THEN 'Asia'
     ELSE NULL
   END;
   GRANT SELECT ON dynamic_sales_view TO ROLE north_america_manager;
   GRANT SELECT ON dynamic_sales_view TO ROLE europe_manager;
   GRANT SELECT ON dynamic_sales_view TO ROLE asia_manager;
----

8. **Testing the Dynamic Secure View**
   . Log in as different regional managers and query the **dynamic_sales_view**:
   
[source,sql]
----
   SELECT * FROM dynamic_sales_view;
----
   . Verify that each user only sees data for their respective region.

9. **Granting Access to Multiple Roles**
   . If a user needs access to multiple regions, grant them access to multiple roles and adjust the view logic:
   
[source,sql]
----
   CREATE ROLE global_manager;
   GRANT ROLE north_america_manager TO ROLE global_manager;
   GRANT ROLE europe_manager TO ROLE global_manager;
----

10. **Creating a View for Global Managers**
   . Create a view for global managers that provides access to all data:
   
[source,sql]
----
   CREATE SECURE VIEW global_sales_view AS
   SELECT * FROM sales_data_rls;
   GRANT SELECT ON global_sales_view TO ROLE global_manager;
----

11. **Testing Access for Global Managers**
   . Log in as the **global_manager** and verify access to all regions:
   
[source,sql]
----
   SELECT * FROM global_sales_view;
----

12. **Enforcing Security Audits**
   . Use the **QUERY_HISTORY** view to track who accessed which regionâ€™s data:
  
[source,sql]
 ----
   SELECT * FROM QUERY_HISTORY WHERE QUERY_TEXT ILIKE '%sales_view%';
----

13. **Creating Row-Level Policies for Compliance**
   . If needed, create additional row-level policies to ensure compliance with data protection regulations:
  
[source,sql]
----
   CREATE SECURE VIEW compliance_sales_view AS
   SELECT * FROM sales_data_rls WHERE region = 'Europe' AND CURRENT_ROLE() = 'EUROPE_MANAGER';
----

14. **Automating Role-Based Data Access**
   . Set up Snowflake tasks to automatically update roles or grant additional privileges as users move between regions or teams.

15. **Revoking Access**
   . Revoke access from users or roles that no longer require it:
   
[source,sql]
----
   REVOKE SELECT ON north_america_sales_view FROM ROLE north_america_manager;
----

== Conclusion
- You have successfully implemented row-level security in Snowflake using secure views, ensuring that users can only access data based on their roles and regions.
