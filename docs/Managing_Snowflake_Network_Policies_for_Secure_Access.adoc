= Lab 28: Managing Snowflake Network Policies for Secure Access  


== Objective
In this lab, you will configure Snowflake network policies to manage and restrict access to your Snowflake instance based on specific IP address ranges for enhanced security.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access with admin privileges.

== Steps
1. **Creating a Network Policy**
   . Create a network policy to restrict access to a specific IP range:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE NETWORK POLICY restrict_access ALLOWED_IP_LIST = ('192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.2/24');
----


2. **Applying the Network Policy**
. Apply the network policy to a specific user:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER USER john_doe SET NETWORK_POLICY = restrict_access;
----


3. **Testing Network Restrictions**
. Log in as the user from an IP address outside the allowed range to verify access is restricted.

4. **Monitoring Network Policy Enforcement**
. Use the **LOGIN_HISTORY** view to monitor logins and check for network policy enforcement:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM LOGIN_HISTORY WHERE USER_NAME = 'JOHN_DOE';

----


5. **Modifying Network Policies**
. Modify the network policy to update the allowed IP addresses:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER NETWORK POLICY restrict_access SET ALLOWED_IP_LIST = ('192.168.2.1', '192.168.2.2/24');
----


== Conclusion
- You have successfully implemented and managed network policies in Snowflake to secure access to your instance based on IP address restrictions.
