= Lab 5: Secure Data Sharing in Snowflake  


== Objective
In this lab, you will configure secure data sharing between two Snowflake accounts.

== Prerequisites
- Two Snowflake accounts or access to a shared Snowflake instance.

== Steps
1. **Creating a Share**
   . Log into your primary Snowflake account and create a share:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE SHARE employee_data_share; GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE demo_db TO SHARE employee_data_share;

----


2. **Granting Access**
. Grant access to the specific table you want to share:

[source,sql]
----
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO SHARE employee_data_share;
----


3. **Consuming the Share**
. Log into the secondary Snowflake account and consume the share:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE employee_db FROM SHARE primary_account.employee_data_share;
----


4. **Querying Shared Data**
. Query the shared data from the secondary account:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM employee_db.public.employees;
----

== Conclusion
- You have successfully shared data securely between two Snowflake accounts.
