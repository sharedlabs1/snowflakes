= Lab 27: Implementing Zero-Copy Cloning for DevOps Workflows  


== Objective
In this lab, you will learn how to use Snowflake's zero-copy cloning feature to create efficient dev/test environments without duplicating data, allowing teams to work in parallel with minimal overhead.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.

== Steps
1. **Creating a Primary Table**
   . Create a table in your production environment:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE production_sales (id INT, amount DECIMAL(10,2), sale_date DATE); 
INSERT INTO production_sales VALUES (1, 100.50, '2023-01-01'), (2, 200.75, '2023-01-02');


----


2. **Creating a Zero-Copy Clone**
. Clone the **production_sales** table to create a dev/test version:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dev_sales CLONE production_sales;

----


3. **Verifying the Clone**
. Query both the original and the cloned table to verify that they share the same data:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM production_sales; SELECT * FROM dev_sales;
----


4. **Modifying the Clone**
. Make modifications to the cloned table:

[source,sql]
----

INSERT INTO dev_sales VALUES (3, 300.50, '2023-01-03'); DELETE FROM dev_sales WHERE id = 1;
----


5. **Ensuring Zero-Copy Efficiency**
. Review the storage efficiency of zero-copy cloning using the **TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS** view:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'DEV_SALES';
----


6. **Recloning for Parallel Workflows**
. Reclone tables or databases as needed to allow multiple teams to work in parallel with minimal resource duplication.

== Conclusion
- You have successfully used zero-copy cloning to create dev/test environments in Snowflake, enabling efficient parallel workflows without duplicating data.
