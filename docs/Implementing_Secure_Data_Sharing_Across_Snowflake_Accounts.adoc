= Lab 35: Implementing Secure Data Sharing Across Snowflake Accounts  


== Objective
In this lab, you will configure secure data sharing between Snowflake accounts, enabling access to shared datasets without copying or moving the data.

== Prerequisites
- Two Snowflake accounts (or a shared account to simulate two environments).
- Administrative privileges in both accounts.

== Steps
1. **Creating a Share in the Primary Account**
   . Log in to the primary Snowflake account and create a data share:
[source,sql]
----
   CREATE SHARE sales_share;
----

2. **Granting Access to Databases and Tables**
   . Grant access to a specific database and table to the share:
   
[source,sql]
----
   GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE sales_db TO SHARE sales_share;
   GRANT SELECT ON sales_db.public.sales_data TO SHARE sales_share;
----

3. **Adding a Consumer Account**
   . Grant access to the external consumer account (or secondary account):
   
[source,sql]
----
   ALTER SHARE sales_share ADD ACCOUNT = 'CONSUMER_ACCOUNT_NAME';
----

4. **Verifying the Share Configuration**
   . Use the **SHARE_PRIVILEGES** view to check which privileges have been granted:

[source,sql]
----
   SELECT * FROM SHARE_PRIVILEGES WHERE SHARE_NAME = 'SALES_SHARE';
----

5. **Consuming the Share in the Consumer Account**
   . Log in to the consumer account and create a database from the shared data:
  
[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE shared_sales_db FROM SHARE primary_account.sales_share;
----

6. **Querying the Shared Data**
   . Query the shared data from the consumer account:

[source,sql]
----
   SELECT * FROM shared_sales_db.public.sales_data;
----

7. **Validating the Access Controls**
   . Ensure that the consumer account only has read-only access by testing SELECT queries.

8. **Adding More Data to the Shared Table**
   . Insert more data into the **sales_data** table in the primary account:
   
[source,sql]
----
   INSERT INTO sales_db.public.sales_data VALUES (5, 'Product E', 700, '2023-10-02');

----

9. **Verifying Data Updates in the Consumer Account**
   . Query the shared table in the consumer account to confirm new data is accessible:
   
[source,sql]
----
   SELECT * FROM shared_sales_db.public.sales_data;
----

10. **Sharing Multiple Tables**
   . Share multiple tables by adding them to the same share:
   
[source,sql]
----
   GRANT SELECT ON sales_db.public.customers TO SHARE sales_share;

----

11. **Revoking Access to the Share**
   . Revoke access to specific tables from the share if needed:
  
[source,sql]
----
   REVOKE SELECT ON sales_db.public.customers FROM SHARE sales_share;
----

12. **Monitoring Data Sharing Activity**
   . Monitor data sharing activity in the primary account:
   
[source,sql]
----
   SELECT * FROM ACCOUNT_USAGE.SHARES WHERE SHARE_NAME = 'SALES_SHARE';
----

13. **Creating a Secure View for Shared Data**
   . Create a secure view to share only specific fields from the shared table:
   
[source,sql]
----
   CREATE SECURE VIEW shared_sales_view AS
   SELECT id, product, amount FROM sales_db.public.sales_data;
   GRANT SELECT ON shared_sales_view TO SHARE sales_share;

----

14. **Testing the Secure View in the Consumer Account**
   . Query the secure view from the consumer account:
   
[source,sql]
----
   SELECT * FROM shared_sales_db.public.shared_sales_view;
----

15. **Disabling the Share**
   . If needed, disable the data share:
   
[source,sql]
----
   DROP SHARE sales_share;
----

== Conclusion
- You have successfully configured secure data sharing between Snowflake accounts, providing access to shared datasets without data movement.
