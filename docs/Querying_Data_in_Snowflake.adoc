= Lab 3: Querying Data in Snowflake  


== Objective
In this lab, you will run basic and advanced SQL queries in Snowflake, including filtering, aggregation, and joins.

== Prerequisites
- A Snowflake database with data loaded (e.g., employees table).

== Steps
1. **Basic Queries**
   . Run basic SELECT queries to retrieve data:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM employees;
----


2. **Filtering Data**
. Apply WHERE conditions to filter records:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
----


3. **Aggregating Data**
. Use aggregate functions to summarize data:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT department, AVG(age) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
----


4. **Joining Tables**
. Create a second table for departments:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT department, AVG(age) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
----

. Perform a JOIN query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT e.name, d.department_name FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department = d.id;
----


== Conclusion
- You have successfully run basic and advanced SQL queries in Snowflake, including filtering, aggregation, and joins.
