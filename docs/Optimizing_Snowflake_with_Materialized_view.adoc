= Lab 22: Optimizing Snowflake with Materialized Views and Clustering  


== Objective
In this lab, you will optimize data access in Snowflake using materialized views and clustering to improve query performance on large datasets.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.

== Steps

1. **Creating a Large Table for Optimization**
   . Create a large table with sales data:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sales_data_large (id INT, amount DECIMAL(10, 2), category STRING); 
INSERT INTO sales_data_large SELECT SEQ8(), RAND() * 1000, RANDOM() FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => 1000000));
----

2. **Creating a Materialized View**
. Create a materialized view to optimize querying:

[source,sql]
----

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary_large AS SELECT category, SUM(amount) AS total_sales FROM sales_data_large GROUP BY category;
----


3. **Querying the Materialized View**
. Query the materialized view to observe the performance improvement:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM sales_summary_large;
----


4. **Applying Clustering**
. Add clustering to the large table to optimize queries based on the **category** column:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE sales_data_large CLUSTER BY (category);
----


5. **Monitoring the Impact of Clustering**
. Use the **CLUSTERING_INFORMATION** view to monitor clustering efficiency:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM CLUSTERING_INFORMATION WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'sales_data_large';
----


== Conclusion
- You have successfully used materialized views and clustering to optimize data access in Snowflake for large datasets, improving query performance.
