= Lab 17: Performance Tuning Best Practices in Snowflake  


== Objective
In this lab, you will apply best practices for performance tuning in Snowflake, including query optimization, clustering, and using result caching.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.

== Steps

1. **Optimizing Query Performance**
   . Use the **QUERY_HISTORY** view to identify slow-running queries:

[source,sql]
----

SELECT * FROM QUERY_HISTORY WHERE EXECUTION_STATUS = 'SUCCESS' ORDER BY TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME DESC;
----


2. **Applying Result Caching**
. Enable result caching to speed up repeated queries:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULTS = TRUE;
----


3. **Using Clustering for Large Tables**
. Add clustering to optimize large tables:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE large_sales_table CLUSTER BY (category);
----


4. **Monitoring Query Statistics**
. Use the **QUERY_HISTORY** view to monitor query execution plans and analyze statistics:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM QUERY_HISTORY WHERE EXECUTION_STATUS = 'SUCCESS';
----


== Conclusion
- You have successfully applied performance tuning techniques in Snowflake to optimize query performance, including result caching and clustering.
