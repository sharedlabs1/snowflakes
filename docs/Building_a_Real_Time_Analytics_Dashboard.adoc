= Lab 33: Building a Real-Time Analytics Dashboard with Snowflake and Tableau  


== Objective
In this lab, you will create a real-time analytics dashboard by integrating Snowflake with Tableau, enabling dynamic data visualization for real-time decision-making.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.
- Tableau Desktop or Tableau Online.
- Sample dataset in Snowflake (e.g., sales or product data).

== Steps
1. **Creating the Source Table**
   . Create a source table in Snowflake to hold real-time sales data:
   
[source,sql]
   ----
   CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE real_time_sales (
     id INT, 
     product STRING, 
     amount DECIMAL(10, 2), 
     sale_date TIMESTAMP
   );
   ----

2. **Inserting Initial Data**
   . Insert some initial data into the table:
   
[source,sql]
   ----
   INSERT INTO real_time_sales VALUES 
   (1, 'Product A', 500.00, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), 
   (2, 'Product B', 300.00, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
   ----

3. **Creating a Snowpipe for Continuous Data Ingestion**
   . Create a stage and pipe to automate the continuous loading of new data:
   
[source,sql]
   ----
   CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE sales_stage;
   CREATE OR REPLACE PIPE sales_pipe AS
   COPY INTO real_time_sales FROM @sales_stage FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV');
   ----

4. **Connecting Tableau to Snowflake**
   . In Tableau, connect to your Snowflake instance using the Snowflake connector.
   . Enter your Snowflake credentials and select the **real_time_sales** table.

5. **Building a Simple Dashboard**
   . In Tableau, build a simple dashboard to visualize sales by product:
   . Drag **Product** to the **Rows** shelf and **SUM(Amount)** to the **Columns** shelf.
   . Add **Sale Date** to the **Pages** shelf to create a time-series view.

6. **Customizing the Dashboard**
   . Add filters for **Product** and **Sale Date** to allow users to dynamically filter the data.
   . Customize the chart to display bars for each productâ€™s sales.

7. **Publishing the Dashboard to Tableau Online**
   . Publish the dashboard to Tableau Online for real-time access:
   . Select **Server** > **Publish Workbook** and configure the connection.

8. **Adding More Data for Real-Time Analysis**
   . Simulate new sales by inserting more data into the **real_time_sales** table:
  
[source,sql]
   ----
   INSERT INTO real_time_sales VALUES (3, 'Product C', 450.00, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
   ----

9. **Refreshing the Tableau Dashboard**
   . Refresh the dashboard in Tableau to display the new sales data in real-time.

10. **Configuring Real-Time Updates in Tableau**
   . Configure Tableau to auto-refresh every 1 minute to capture new incoming data.

11. **Monitoring Snowpipe for Continuous Data Loads**
   . Monitor the **PIPE_USAGE_HISTORY** to track how data is loaded into Snowflake:
  
[source,sql]
   ----
   SELECT * FROM PIPE_USAGE_HISTORY WHERE PIPE_NAME = 'SALES_PIPE';
   ----

12. **Visualizing Trends and Comparisons**
   . In Tableau, create trend lines to visualize sales growth over time.
   . Add comparison metrics to compare product sales between periods.

13. **Creating Alerts in Tableau**
   . Set up email or SMS alerts in Tableau to notify users when sales cross certain thresholds.

14. **Integrating External Data Sources**
   . Join additional datasets in Tableau (e.g., marketing or regional data) to enhance the analysis.

15. **Optimizing the Dashboard for Performance**
   . In Tableau, optimize the dashboard by using extracts for historical data and live connections for real-time data.

== Conclusion
- You have built a real-time analytics dashboard using Snowflake and Tableau, continuously loading and visualizing real-time sales data.
