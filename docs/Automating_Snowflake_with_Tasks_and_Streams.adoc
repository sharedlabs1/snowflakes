= Lab 24: Automating Snowflake with Tasks and Streams  
 


== Objective
In this lab, you will automate data processing in Snowflake using tasks and streams to track changes and run scheduled jobs.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.

== Steps

1. **Creating a Table for Change Tracking**
   . Create a table to store product data:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE products (id INT, name STRING, price DECIMAL(10, 2)); INSERT INTO products VALUES (1, 'Product A', 100), (2, 'Product B', 150);
----


2. **Creating a Stream to Track Changes**
. Create a stream to track changes (inserts, updates, deletes) on the **products** table:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE STREAM product_changes ON TABLE products;
----


3. **Creating a Task to Process Changes**
. Create a task that runs periodically to process changes from the stream:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK process_product_changes WAREHOUSE = 'COMPUTE_WH' SCHEDULE = '5 MINUTE' AS INSERT INTO product_audit SELECT * FROM product_changes WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT';
----


4. **Running the Task**
. Run the task manually or wait for it to execute according to the schedule:

[source,sql]
----

EXECUTE TASK process_product_changes;
----


5. **Monitoring Task Execution**
. Use the **TASK_HISTORY** view to monitor task execution and status:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM TASK_HISTORY WHERE TASK_NAME = 'PROCESS_PRODUCT_CHANGES';

----


== Conclusion
- You have successfully automated data processing in Snowflake using tasks and streams, enabling continuous tracking and processing of table changes.
