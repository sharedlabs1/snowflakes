= Lab 19: Using Snowflake Streams for Change Data Capture (CDC)  


== Objective
In this lab, you will configure and use Snowflake streams for change data capture (CDC) to track changes in a table and manage incremental data loads.

== Prerequisites
- Snowflake account access.

== Steps

1. **Creating a Table for CDC**
   . Create a table to store employee data:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE employees_cdc (id INT, name STRING, department STRING); INSERT INTO employees_cdc VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'HR'), (2, 'Jane Smith', 'IT');

----


2. **Creating a Stream to Track Changes**
. Create a Snowflake stream to capture changes (inserts, updates, deletes) on the **employees_cdc** table:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM employees_stream ON TABLE employees_cdc;

----


3. **Making Changes to the Table**
. Insert, update, and delete records in the **employees_cdc** table:

[source,sql]
----
NSERT INTO employees_cdc VALUES (3, 'Alice Johnson', 'Finance');
UPDATE employees_cdc SET department = 'Engineering' WHERE id = 2;
DELETE FROM employees_cdc WHERE id = 1;

----


4. **Querying the Stream for Changes**
. Query the stream to view the changes made to the table:

[source,sql]
----

SELECT * FROM employees_stream;
----


5. **Managing the Change Data**
. Use the stream to manage incremental data loads into another table:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO employees_incremental SELECT * FROM employees_stream;
----


== Conclusion
- You have successfully used Snowflake streams for change data capture, tracking changes in a table and managing incremental data loads.
